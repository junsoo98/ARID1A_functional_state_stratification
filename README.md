## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Data Source ‚Äì TCGA UCEC Cohort**
    
    This analysis pipeline uses data from the **TCGA Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)** cohort.
    
    You can obtain the data via the [GDC Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) or by using the R package **`TCGAbiolinks`**.
    
    The current code supports both methods and organizes the files into subdirectories under the `dataset/` folder.
    
2. **Indexing Issues**
    
    Some parts of the analysis access dataframes using integer-based indexing (e.g., `iloc`).
    
    Depending on the dataset version or file loading behavior, row ordering may differ.
    
    Manual adjustments to indices may be necessary to align with the expected structure.
    
3. **External Data Requirements**
    
    This pipeline uses several **external datasets** not bundled with the repository. These include:
    
    - miRDB target prediction data
    - miRNA arm feature annotations
    - Illumina CpG probe ID reference
    - `gencode.v43.annotation.gtf.gz` for gene annotation
    
    You may need to download these resources separately depending on your use case.
